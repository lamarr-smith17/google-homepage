A simple recreation of the Google homepage to get familarized with HTML and CSS.
This was a project that was apart of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard). (THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER ON THE ODIN PROJECT, IT IS A RETIRED PROJECT)
This site is currently not responsive, however, I do plan on coming back to this and making it responsive in the future.
THIS SITE HAS BEEN UPDATED TO BETTER REFLECT MY UNDERSTANDING OF CSS POSITION AND CSS FLEXBOX.
